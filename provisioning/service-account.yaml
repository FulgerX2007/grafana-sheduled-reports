# Grafana Service Account Provisioning
#
# NOTE: This file is NO LONGER NEEDED for Grafana 10.3+
#
# The plugin now uses Grafana's managed service accounts feature.
# Service accounts are automatically created and managed by Grafana
# based on the IAM permissions defined in plugin.json.
#
# No manual service account provisioning or token configuration required.
#
# For Grafana versions older than 10.3, you can use this file to provision
# a service account manually, but this is not recommended for new deployments.
